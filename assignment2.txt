var:
the variables can be declared global or local scope.
This is mostly not used to avoid confusion.

let:
The variables are declared only in a particular block of code( {....} )
, whenevr multiple people working on one project there might be chances that
same variable name maybe used and it mught create problems during debugging.

const:
The constants values which wont be changed at any point in the program.
So declaring a variable using 'const' the value wont change.
